## About The Project

[![Website Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://canostra.000webhostapp.com/)

For this project, you have to imagine that you are in charge of the digitalization process of a classic offline business (artisans, clothing stores, bars, etc.).

Your task is to create the website of the business, putting all your imagination and helping it to enter the digital world thanks to your skills.

The compulsory requests that we make are three:
- There must be a contact form on the site.
- There must be an integrated map to allow customers to immediately see where the business is located.
- You must create a custom theme from scratch (otherwise it's too easy to use those already available!).

For the rest, you can choose any type of store or service. Let your creative streak run wild!
